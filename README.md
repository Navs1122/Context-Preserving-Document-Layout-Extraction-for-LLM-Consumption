# Context-Preserving-Document-Layout-Extraction-for-LLM-Consumption
This project focuses on developing a Streamlit-based document layout extraction system tailored for LLM consumption. The system is capable of parsing complex documents—such as PDFs, scanned images, and Office files into structured formats like JSON and CSV, preserving the original reading order. Leveraging PaddleOCR’s PPStructureV3 for layout detection and OCR, along with a robust fallback parser based on row grouping and KMeans clustering, the app accurately extracts tables, paragraphs, headings, and footnotes. It ensures that extracted data retains its semantic structure and is optimized for downstream NLP tasks such as summarization or retrieval. The final deliverable is an interactive web app that allows users to upload documents and download logically ordered structured outputs, enabling seamless integration with large language models.
